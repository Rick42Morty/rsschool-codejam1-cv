            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>After leaving Gomel at the age of 17, I spent 8 years in Moscow
              (mainly studying) and 2.5 years in China (doing PhD in
              Engineering, which I dropped in spring 2018 for personal
              reasons). I’ve never had an office job, I’ve been a remote
              technical translator for almost 8 years, which was more than
              enough to earn my living during study.</p>
            <p>This year I’ve returned home and decided to dive into IT
              industry. I’ve chosen frontend web-development, because it the
              fastest way to start building something real. I’ve always known,
              that EPAM is the best employer in IT industry in Belarus, I
              have several friends and acquaintances working in this company.
              That’s why I became a Rolling Scopes School student. I believe
              that competition and strong community will help me to grow my
              expertise in frontend really fast.</p>
            <p>After I get a solid knowledge of frontend stack, I plan to
              master some back-end technology (Node.js or Python+Django
              and databases) in order to have an ability to build full-stack
              projects or at least to understand all the stages of building
              a real-world project.</p>

            <h3>Skills</h3>
            <p>I can’t say that I’m a master of any technology, but in different
              periods of my life I’ve put my hands on C, C++, Java, Python,
              SQL, VB languages (just for my study or for fun, I don’t have
              any relevant development experience). I’m familiar with ML and
              have some experience with Matlab and statistics packages.</p>
            <p>Right now I’m a student of Rolling Scopes School, so my
              knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript stack is growing pretty fast.
              I suppose, in couple months it will be my main expertise.</p>
